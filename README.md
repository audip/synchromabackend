# Synchroma Backend [Best use of CapitalOne's Nessie API award, TAMUHack 2016]

Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/synchroma

## Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from our own experiences as programmers, where we realized that it is sometimes difficult to send secure data physically. We wondered whether it was possible to encode messages through color of the RGB spectrum.

## What it does
synChroma utilizes a new form of encryption by using each characters unique ascii value. First, we convert text to the unique encryption then broadcast the encypted message via color. Then we read it back in and decode it on another device.

## How we built it
We built this using iOS Swift 3, to give us access to a portable device. We used Node as our backend with Amazon Web Services on the backend. We also are using AngularJS to load the desktop app.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into issues with a camera processing the RGB values of an LCD screen. We also ran into some technical issues that we tried to overcome.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We worked together all as a team and we learned more about iOS Swift 3.

## What we learned
Swift 3, AngularJS, Texas A&M.

## What's next for synChroma
We are really passionate about synChroma, and think that this is a project that can definitely help a lot of people. Therefore, we plan on continuing to work on synChroma, improving and adding functionality so that we can one day release this as a product so that everyone can experience synChroma.
